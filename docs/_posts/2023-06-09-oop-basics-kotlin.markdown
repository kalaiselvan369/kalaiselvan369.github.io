Working with classes, constructors and access modifiers in Kotlin
<!--more-->

## Object Oriented Programming

It is a computer programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Object contains state 
in the form of attributes or properties and actions in the form of method or functions.

In OOP, we representing real world objects into a model/object to derive solution for a particular problem.

### Example 

Let's talk about computer monitor. It comes out with variety of size, color, model which we can call it as attributes
or properties and on, off, restart capabilities which we can call it as methods or functions.

## Class

- It is a user defined data type
- class declartion consists of class name, header(constructor, constructor parameter) and body.
- class body contains properties and functions
- member function means function defined within a class
- memeber property means val/var that belong to a class
- Object is derived from instantiating a class
- var or val is used to hold state of the object
- var enable us to rebind reference to different object
- Mutability means an object can change its state

## Constructors

Special type of member function to instantiate a class.

## Access Modifiers

1. public
2. private
3. protected
4. internal - it is accessible only inside the module in which the class/function/property is declared

### Top level function/property/classes

Top level functions, property and classes that are declared `private` are accessible 
only within the file where they are declared.

## Packages

Enables resuability and grouping classess, functions and property.
