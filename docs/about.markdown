Hello, Greetings for the day!!! 

I am Kalaiselvan working as a Senior Software Engineer(Android Platform). 

I have around 8 years of experience in crafting android applications using Java and Kotlin programming language 
and 1 year of experience in building iOS apps. I have been a Technical Lead for the team of 5 engineers 
and motivated them to write unit tests and educated them about the importance of applying SOLID, DRY, KISS principles while building software. I have published more than 5 android applications in google play store which were developed from scratch. I preferrably use MVVM architecture pattern in the most of the mobile apps I develop & occasionally multi module architecture pattern depending upon the business need. Here are some of the third party libraries which I have used 
Dagger, Hilt, RxJava, Glide, Coil, Coroutines, Retrofit, OkHttp, Timber, Room, SQLDelight. I have hands on experience in app publishing process(CI-CD) using Fastlane via gitlab or github actions.
